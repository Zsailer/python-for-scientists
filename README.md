# Python for scientists

[See the full page.](http://python-setup-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

*For many scientists, the open-source nature of Python is intimidating. They’d like to use Python and Jupyter notebooks, but they don’t know how to begin. Proprietary software like Matlab and Mathematica comes pre-packaged and ready out-of-the-box, but Python is less straightforward. Our goal is to provide a quick guide to help scientists get started.*

[4 steps to Python](http://python-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_pages/install_python.html) for scientists:

1. Install Python using Miniconda
2. Install the Jupyter Notebook
3. Install core scientific packages
