Installing Python
=================

The easiest way to install Python is by installing **Miniconda**.

Even if your machine already has Python, it's best not to mess with the native Python. On Macs, for example, many programs depend on that native Python. If you break it, you can break your Mac.

Miniconda is self-contained. It installs Python and manages Python packages inside a single folder. It's very lightweight and simple to use. And if anything goes wrong, you can always uninstall Miniconda and start fresh.
