Python for Scientists
=====================


    *"For many scientists, the open-source nature of Python is intimidating. They want to use Python and Jupyter notebooks, but they don't know how to begin. Proprietary software like Matlab and Mathematica comes pre-packaged and ready out-of-the-box, but Python seems more complicated. We wanted to provide a quick guide to help scientists get started."*---Zach Sailer
