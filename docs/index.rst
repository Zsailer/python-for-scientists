Python for Scientists
=====================


If you're visiting this page, you're probably a scientist who is trying to install Python. You're probably new to Python. Perhaps your collaborators sent you a Jupyter notebook (whatever that is). Or you're looking for a free, open-source alternative to Matlab/Mathematica.

This guide describes a path-of-least-resistance to setting up Python for science. This means installing Python, Jupyter notebooks, and key scientific libraries.
