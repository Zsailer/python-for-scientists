Python for Scientists
=====================

Welcome! **This page is still being developed!** Check back in a few days!

If you're visiting this page, you're probably a scientist who is trying to install Python. You're probably new to Python. Perhaps your collaborators sent you some a Jupyter notebook (whatever that is). Or you're looking for a free, open-source alternative to Matlab/Mathematica.

This guide offers a simple way to install Python for a scientist. This means installing Python, Jupyter notebooks, and key scientific libraries.
