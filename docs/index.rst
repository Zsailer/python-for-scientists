Python for Scientists
=====================


    *"For many scientists, the open-source nature of Python is intimidating. They would like to use something like Jupyter notebooks, but they don't know where to begin. Proprietary software like Matlab and Mathematica is pre-packaged and ready out-of-the-box. We wanted to provide a quick guide to getting started with scientific Python."*  ---Zach Sailer


This page describes `4 steps to starting Python`_ for **scientists**:

1. Install Python using Miniconda
2. Install the Jupyter Notebook
