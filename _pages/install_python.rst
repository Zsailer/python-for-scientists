Installing Python
=================

For scientists, I strongly recommend installing Python using **Miniconda**--even if you have Python already installed on your machine.

It's best not to mess with the native Python on your machine. On Macs, for example, many programs depend on that native Python. If you break it, you can break your Mac.

Miniconda installs and manages Python (and it's packages) in a single folder on your computer. It's lightweight and easy to use. If anything goes wrong, you can always startover by uninstalling and reinstalling Miniconda. It's safe!
